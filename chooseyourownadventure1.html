<p style="float: center;">One day, there was a MONSTER APOCALYPSE! It was terrifying, and you were one of very few survivors in the small town.<br/>
You were starving a month after the Monster Apocalypse, so you decided to snatch some food from a store with your weapon, the Slicer.<br/>
You only knew the 2 closest stores; The Mall and the Market. You've seen just about every zombie movie, so you know alot.<br/>
Zombies LOVE the mall, so more inside the mall, and less in the way. The Market has a different story; less inside, more in the way.<br/>
Which way do you go?
